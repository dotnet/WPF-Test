    <!--
         When meshes are behind a Perspective Camera, their bounds can be projected to strange places.
         This test places a camera in the center of a single-coiled spiral and aims it slightly downward.
         This causes the bug to repro on older bits where the projected bounds clipped half of the visible area.
         The scene would still render properly even though the hit test bounds were incorrect.
         The last three variations on each camera failed on the old bits.
