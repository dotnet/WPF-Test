                So, the other day, my battery in my car died, but I'm not going to mention that. No, I'm going to mention my water pump. I bought the water pump from a local auto parts store and it came with a warranty. The warranty said "Limited Lifetime Warranty", excluding the casting, shaft, bearing and rotor. For those of you who do not know anything about water pumps, the four components are, the casting, shaft, bearing and rotor. So now I have a limited warranty on nothing. I can see myself having this conversation with a parts clerk, " I bought this water pump here and it quit working. The warranty states that you owe me nothing and that's what I expect." The clerks response, " I'm sorry sir but your nothing is limited."
