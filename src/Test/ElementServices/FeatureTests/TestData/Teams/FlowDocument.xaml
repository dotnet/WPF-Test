		It's officially a dogfight between <Bold>Shingo Takatsu</Bold> and <Bold>Dustin Hermanson</Bold> for the closers gig on the South Side of Chicago. Of course, <Bold>Damaso Marte</Bold> will see a few save chances, but he's more valuable as a set-up man because of his ability to shut down left-handed bats. Take a look at the last seven save opportunities for the White Sox:

	<Paragraph Style="{DynamicResource normaPara}" Name="FirstParagraph">
		Before Marte popped his head in there, <Bold>Ozzie Guillen</Bold> had a nice little rotation with Takatsu and Hermanson switching off every other day. Marte struggled to record his second save of the season Sunday, but Guillen chose to stick with him even though he had Takatsu warmed up in the pen. That shows the manager's confidence in Shingo has diminished in recent weeks.

	<Paragraph Style="{DynamicResource normaPara}">Who is going to win the dogfight? A lot is going to depend future performance. We just have to see how this plays out. If both guys continue to nail down saves, we might see this two-headed monster for a little while. That said, a blown save by either candidate could quickly settle the argument. Thanks to a 0.00 ERA, Hermanson probably has a little more wiggle room than Takatsu right now, but don't count Takatsu out just yet. </Paragraph>

	<Paragraph Style="{DynamicResource normaPara}">Has the league caught up to Takatsu in his second year or has he just run into a string of bad outings? It's impossible to tell with such a small sample size, but Takatsu has a very good track record in closing out games.</Paragraph>

	<Paragraph Style="{DynamicResource normaPara}">I'd be a little more worried if this implosion occurred in September. Takatsu slumped for a stretch in 2004, but managed to bounce back. It looks like Shingo can overcome his poor start to be an effective closer for the White Sox this season. He will, however, need to break out of this mini-slump soon before Hermanson snatches the job out of his hands.</Paragraph>

	<Paragraph Style="{DynamicResource normaPara}">Hermanson was a nice surprise last year when he took over the closer's gig in San Francisco. Despite his 4.33 ERA, he saved 17 games and turned himself into a key contributor in fantasy leagues down the stretch. But what a difference a year makes. What's troublesome is that opposing hitters are still seeing the ball pretty well when facing Hermanson, as evidenced by the similar BAA. Part of his success can be attributed to his improved control, but it seems more likely that he will come back to earth in the near future.</Paragraph>

			<Bold>Atlanta Braves:</Bold> In last year's 39-save season, <Bold>Danny Kolb</Bold> learned that a pitcher does not need to strike everyone out to be successful. He attacked the strike zone and pitched to contact, rather than shying away from it and finished the year with only 15 walks in 57 1/3 innings. Kolb's control has deserted him this season - 10 walks in 12 innings. Granted, he has thrown three shutout innings since his implosion against the Mets on April 26, but he's allowed two free passes during that time. Since his stuff is not dominating (only 21 Ks last year) Kolb must rely on his command of the strike zone to get batters out. If he can't bear down and hit his spots, it's going to be a long year for the Braves closer. With <Bold>Chris Reitsma</Bold> (14 1/3 IP, 0.63 ERA) and <Bold>Adam Bernero</Bold> (15 IP, 3.00 ERA) waiting in the wings, Kolb better figure things out soon.

		<Bold>Arizona Diamondbacks:</Bold> Everyone's talking about <Bold>Brandon Lyon's</Bold> 11 saves and 1.93 ERA but his underlying numbers suggest that his success may be a bit of a mirage. Opposing batters are hitting .310 against Lyon, which is not far off from his career .292 BAA. In case you were wondering, pitchers who give up that many hits do not usually finish the season with a low ERA. Lyon's job is safe and he'll be valuable for saves but expect his ERA to climb sooner rather than later.

		<Bold>Chicago Cubs</Bold>: After another blown save on Friday, <Bold>LaTroy Hawkins</Bold> most likely will be removed from the closer's role within the week. Again. Hawk has never been comfortable as a stopper as evidenced by his 30 career blown saves. In fact, as a Hawkins owner, I can't wait until he is removed from the closer's role because he may be more valuable as a setup man. <Bold>Dusty Baker</Bold> seems to be initiating the move already as he had <Bold>Ryan Dempster</Bold> (Monday's scheduled starter) warming up towards the end of the Cubs' 2-1 victory over the Phillies Sunday. Dempster saved two games last season for the Cubs but he still walks too many guys (22 BB in 33 2/3 innings). If Dempster is anointed the closer in Chicago, it may be short lived because <Bold>Joe Borowski</Bold> has looked good in his two rehab appearances, and Baker might just hand the job over to him.

There's talk that Mota's injury may be more serious than originally expected so Jones could have plenty of value over the next month.

His control (13/7 K/BB rate) is worrisome so his 0.91 WHIP and 1.88 ERA are bound to climb, but he's distanced himself from <Bold>Mike Adams</Bold> and appears to be headed in the right direction.

		<Bold>New York Yankees:</Bold> Tough week for <Bold>George</Bold>. First, his Yankees lose five of seven, then <Bold>Bellamy Road</Bold> finishes a disappointing seventh in the Kentucky Derby. As the Yankees struggle, <Bold>Mariano Rivera</Bold> finds himself watching from the bullpen with only 9 2/3 innings on the season. Now is an ideal time to offer up a buy-low deal for the closer, as he will inevitably be given more save opportunities as the Yankees turn things around.

			<Bold>Jermaine Dye's</Bold> sixth-inning home run off <Bold>Pete Walker</Bold> Sunday snapped an 10 2/3-inning streak of no-hit ball by the Blue Jays bullpen. Quite impressive for a relief corps consisting of the aforementioned Walker, <Bold>Justin Speier, Jason Frasor, Vinnie Chulk, Scott Schoeneweis</Bold> and <Bold>Miguel Batista</Bold>. With those type of numbers, it's not surprising that the Jays took four out of six on their road trip against the Yanks and Orioles.

	<Paragraph Style="{DynamicResource normaPara}">
		Be sure to check out <Bold>Ryan Madson</Bold> and <Bold>Mike Gonzalez</Bold>, both of whom are heating up after slow starts. Madson has thrown 7 1/3 scoreless innings with 11 K's while Gonzalez hasn't allowed a run in 6 2/3 innings. Both will end up as valuable middle relievers in fantasy leagues.
