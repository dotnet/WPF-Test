            Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary 
            Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore- 
            While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping 
            As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door 
            " 'T is some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door- 
            Only this and nothing more."

            But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only 
            That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. 
            Nothing farther then he uttered-not a feather then he fluttered- 
            Till I scarcely more than muttered, "Other friends have flown before- 
            On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before." 
            Then the bird said, "Nevermore."
