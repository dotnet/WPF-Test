                        Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary 
                        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore- 
                        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping 
                        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door 
                        " 'T is some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door- 
                        Only this and nothing more."

                            Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; 
                            And each <Bold>separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. 
                            Eagerly I</Bold> wished the morrow;-vainly I had sought to borrow 
                            From my books surcease of sorrow-sorrow for the lost Lenore- 
                            For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore- 
                            Nameless here for evermore.
