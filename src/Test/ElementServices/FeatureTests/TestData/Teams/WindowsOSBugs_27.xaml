			Goals
        The primary goal of the Runtime Logging API is to facilitate the diverse logging requirements of the various test feature teams by extending basic common services to them through a runtime API.  These services will replace the current AutomationFramework solution which is overly dependent on Piper for these services.  By providing these services in the runtime the test cases writer / user experience is consistent in and out the lab as well as with different automation solutions that will be implemented in the future (such as WTT).
        These services include:
        Obtaining information placed by the test author in the TCM at runtime
        Providing machine configuration variation information (like Platform, video card, etc)
        Logging to multiple sources at the same time

        Logging extensibility
        Cross Process / Machine logging 
        Contextual Variation Logging to improve failure analysis
        One of these services is variation logging.  Since the current automation infrastructure (Piper) does not support logging of contextual variation information, the current plan is to utilize these services that are provided by GTO.  The long term goal is to eventually have these services become a native part of the automation infrastructure.
        The scope of this spec will be to understand how GTO logging will integrate with the Logging Runtime API and what the experience of testers will be who will start consuming these services.
