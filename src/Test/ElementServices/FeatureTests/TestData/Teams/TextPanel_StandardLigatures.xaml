        <Paragraph>
            Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary 
            Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore- 
            While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping 
            As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door 
            " 'T is some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door- 
            Only this and nothing more."

        <Paragraph>
            Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; 
            And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. 
            Eagerly I wished the morrow;-vainly I had sought to borrow 
            From my books surcease of sorrow-sorrow for the lost Lenore- 
            For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore- 
            Nameless here for evermore. 
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
            Then the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain 
            Thrilled me-filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; 
            So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating, 
            " 'T is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door- 
            Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;- 
            This it is and nothing more." 
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
            Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, 
            "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; 
            But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, 
            And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, 
            That I scarce was sure I heard you"-here I opened wide the door;- 
            Darkness there and nothing more."
