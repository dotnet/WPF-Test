            Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary 
            Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore- 
            While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping 
            As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door 
            " 'T is some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door- 
            Only this and nothing more."

            Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; 
            And each <Run FontWeight="Bold">separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. 
            Eagerly I</Run> wished the morrow;-vainly I had sought to borrow 
            From my books surcease of sorrow-sorrow for the lost Lenore- 
            For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore- 
            Nameless here for evermore.

            Then the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain 
            Thrilled me-filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; 
            So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating, 
            " 'T is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door- 
            Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;- 
            This it is and nothing more."
