                Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary 
                Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore- 
                While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping 
                As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door 
                " 'T is some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door- 
                Only this and nothing more." 
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; 
                And each <Run FontWeight="Bold">separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. 
                Eagerly I</Run> wished the morrow;-vainly I had sought to borrow 
                From my books surcease of sorrow-sorrow for the lost Lenore- 
                For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore- 
                Nameless here for evermore.

                Then the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain 
                Thrilled me-filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; 
                So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating, 
                " 'T is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door- 
                Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;- 
                This it is and nothing more."
