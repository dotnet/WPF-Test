                            Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary 
                            Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore- 
                            While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping 
                            As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door 
                            " 'T is some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door- 
                            Only this and nothing more."

                            Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; 
                            And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. 
                            Eagerly I wished the morrow;-vainly I had sought to borrow 
                            From my books surcease of sorrow-sorrow for the lost Lenore- 
                            For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-
