                Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary 
                Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore- 
                While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping 
                As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door 
                " 'T is some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door- 
                Only this and nothing more."
