                        Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary 
                        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore-

                        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door 
                        " 'T is some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door-
