to Install: Copy entire DocToRtf2 folder to your local harddrive. Run regdct.bat. Install is done.
Run O12FFVC.exe which is the tool itself.

Much thanks to the office 12 folks for creating the basic tool, though I wonder why their wasn't an 
internal version created and published some time ago. Perhaps there is and I simply haven't found it, 
none the less this is a much trimmed and modified version of their original customer doc collection tool.
