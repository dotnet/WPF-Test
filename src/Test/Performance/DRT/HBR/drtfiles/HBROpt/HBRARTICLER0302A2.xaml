						<Paragraph>Jeff Patterson and his team should face the following realities: The number of consultants GloBank uses is about to drop to one or zero; Jeff&#8217;s friend Bill Holland is in serious trouble; and critical time has been dithered away, perhaps fatally. Thus, Flynn Fuller has only one choice. The team should pitch GloBank as though it were a new account, which involves taking some risks and raising the consultancy&#8217;s sights from a divisional to a corporate perspective.<TextFlow Role="CallOut" TextFlowPresenter.WrapDirection="None">
						<Paragraph Role="CallOut">I&#8217;m not entirely convinced that Jeff hasn&#8217;t dropped the ball.</Paragraph>
				</TextFlow></Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>To stay in the game, Jeff and his team must immediately establish credibility and trustworthiness. In their preparatory sessions, the consultants must directly, personally, and intellectually take on Frank Maloney&#8217;s challenge of quickly reversing GloBank&#8217;s financial and market-share losses. Realistically speaking, Maloney has only about six to 12 months to improve GloBank&#8217;s performance before organizational openness to change disappears and disappointment with his performance sets in.</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>CEOs in his situation desperately need &#8212; or, at least, deeply appreciate &#8212; clear, reliable, unbiased help in identifying, confirming, or refuting hypotheses about the challenges they face. Maloney may welcome consultants who are willing to say the brutally honest, politically incorrect truth. At the same time, it&#8217;s obvious that Maloney harbors serious doubts about consultants, so Jeff must prove his worth, despite feeling that having to do so is unfair.</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>How, then, do Jeff and his team show themselves worthy of Maloney&#8217;s trust? In short, Jeff must review his firm&#8217;s decade of projects and demonstrate past and prospective value creation for GloBank with six slides that will easily cover the one-hour discussion.</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>The first two slides should consist of a table listing projects in rows and accompanying columns of recommendations, qualified and qualitative earnings, growth and sales results, issues or problems, and hindsight comments. The main point of this chart must be that GloBank has received its full $80 million of value, as demonstrated through increased profits and top-line results. The secondary purpose of this chart is to show Maloney that Jeff is a straight shooter from a practice that recognizes and acknowledges its own mistakes. Both of these goals must be achieved in the first 15 minutes of the presentation.</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>Next, Jeff should follow Mark Tannenbaum&#8217;s advice and offer very brief conclusions about how GloBank fits within the likely evolution of the industry, again illustrated with two slides. Jeff must try to identify and focus on a few actions that GloBank can take in response to industry change. At a minimum, he should offer a set of ideas for improving results. These ideas should be known and supported by most of Jeff&#8217;s GloBank clients, especially Bill.</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>It appears that Jeff and the team have given little thought to customers&#8217; view of GloBank&#8217;s services or to alternative competitive approaches GloBank could adopt, both quite critical to this discussion. It shouldn&#8217;t be too hard, however, for Jeff to synthesize customers, competitors, and ongoing GloBank activities into a short, but powerful, priority action list &#8212; again displayed on two slides. This list must be stated from Maloney&#8217;s perspective and grounded squarely in GloBank&#8217;s potential to boost financial performance and market share. If Jeff has been doing his job well, his priority list will match Maloney&#8217;s own, perhaps private, list. Jeff will strike out only if he doesn&#8217;t hit on at least one idea out of three that interests Maloney.</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>Finally, I&#8217;m not entirely convinced that Jeff hasn&#8217;t dropped the ball, or at least become a bit &#8220;flat.&#8221; In particular, few of Jeff&#8217;s colleagues would or should accept Jeff&#8217;s tardy preparation for the new CEO and his &#8220;surprise&#8221; discovery that the new boss cares more deeply about near-term results than relationships. If I were Jeff&#8217;s boss, I&#8217;d insist that Jeff bring into the process a peer who would inject new ideas and challenge the way things are done. I would insist that this peer accompany Jeff to the presentation to act as an alternative, potentially less tainted, adviser to the new CEO.</Paragraph>

						<Paragraph>Consultants are like locomotives. Once they start chugging down an organization&#8217;s tracks, they begin to pick up speed. Sooner or later, no one can stop the trains, and they wind up running over everything and everyone in their paths.</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>It&#8217;s amazingly easy for organizations like GloBank to get hooked on consultants, particularly when times are good, the company is growing, and money is abundant. After all, consultants are seductive: They&#8217;re smart, they bring an outsider&#8217;s perspective, and they&#8217;re free of internal organizational baggage. They offer services you think you can&#8217;t do without, or that you don&#8217;t have time to perform yourself. Pretty soon, you find yourself relying on them more and more.</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>I witnessed the locomotive effect firsthand in my own organization when we were combining a few functional areas into one. The heads of the merging areas brought in a consultant to help them plan the reorganization. After a few months, the managers called a meeting to present the reorganization plan to senior management. In that meeting, the consultant did all the talking. In fact, it was clear that the department heads had ceded all responsibility to the consultant. I didn&#8217;t know who had had the original ideas, who had led the discussions, and who had bought into the plan. Indeed, I didn&#8217;t even know who was running the new organization &#8212; the people I&#8217;d hired to do the job, or the consultant.<TextFlow Role="CallOut">
						<Paragraph Role="CallOut">Consultants are seductive: They&#8217;re smart, they bring an outsider&#8217;s perspective, and they&#8217;re free of internal organizational baggage.</Paragraph>
				</TextFlow></Paragraph>						<Paragraph>GloBank&#8217;s new CEO is right to call these expensive consultants on the carpet. He&#8217;s probably spent his first two months at the company taking a good, hard look at the business fundamentals. In his closed-door meetings with the CFO, he&#8217;s likely taken apart line items like travel expenses and computer equipment, and, odds are, he&#8217;s seen an enormous amount of company money go into Flynn Fuller&#8217;s pockets. He&#8217;d be irresponsible if he didn&#8217;t ask tough questions at a time when his company&#8217;s fortunes are sliding and margins are narrowing.</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>Still, Maloney is approaching the entire Flynn Fuller problem the wrong way. Before he hears from the consultants, he needs to talk to Bill. Bill may, in fact, have very good reasons for having relied on Flynn Fuller&#8217;s advice for so many years, and if so the CEO should hear them. In addition to explaining what Flynn Fuller&#8217;s brilliant insights have done for GloBank during the past decade, Bill should explain why nobody on his own staff, including himself, could come up with these ideas on their own. After all, Bill presumably was hired to bring his knowledge into the organization and to keep up with industry changes on the bank&#8217;s behalf. As a GloBank employee he is an internal consultant. If, by some incredible stroke of luck, Maloney actually has confidence in what Bill says, then he should give the consultants an opportunity to make their case. But if, as I suspect, Bill is simply lazy and has devolved his responsibility over the years to the consultants, Maloney should tell Bill he&#8217;s out of a job, effective immediately, and that Flynn Fuller is out of a client.</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>Of course, it may be that Flynn Fuller has unique, very specific knowledge that no one in the company has. Then it makes sense for GloBank to tap into that expertise on a temporary basis. For example, if GloBank wants to do business in a new country with very specific laws, it makes sense to hire consultants who understand those laws to help set up the new office. But should this relationship last for more than a year? Somehow, I doubt it.</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>Finally, if I were Maloney, I&#8217;d call my managers to a meeting and let them know that I expect all employees to have up-to-date skills and the ability to make informed decisions. I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Either you folks do the job you were hired to do or we&#8217;ll get others to do it &#8212; and I don&#8217;t mean consultants.&#8221;</Paragraph>

						<Paragraph>If Jeff and his team could inject Maloney with truth serum and ask what would it take to keep the account, Maloney might say: &#8220;You must convince me you are relevant and differentiated, that you have meaningful experience, brainpower, a record of past successes, and the proven ability to provide tangible, practical, measurable results for GloBank. You must articulate your relevancy and uniqueness simply, and you must communicate how your insights have consistently led to measurable performance improvement.&#8221; This is a very tall order.<TextFlow Role="CallOut">

				</TextFlow></Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>Flynn Fuller should prepare a strategic framework to respond to Maloney&#8217;s (and the CFO&#8217;s) likely issues. This framework should use deductive reasoning to focus and customize the discussion to its skeptical audience.</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>The framework would consist of three columns; each should list all the known variables influencing the presentation&#8217;s outcome. The left column consists of <Italic>facts and assumptions,</Italic> what the team knows or can hypothesize about Maloney&#8217;s background and intent. The middle column focuses on the <Italic>reasons</Italic> that support these facts and assumptions &#8212; that is, why Maloney might hold his beliefs. The third column is for <Italic>replies</Italic>: relevant benefits and strategic differentiators Flynn Fuller should communicate to address Maloney&#8217;s issues.</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>Let&#8217;s start with the <Italic>facts and assumptions</Italic> column, which should list meaningful facts: GloBank needs a financial and strategic turnaround, the CEO has a directive from the board to quickly reverse the poor financial performance, GloBank has historically relied on consultants, and so on. In addition to the facts, there are also assumptions; for example, the probability that Maloney doesn&#8217;t like consultants. Another assumption is that Maloney is open-minded &#8212; after all, he expressed a willingness to listen to consultancy presentations. It&#8217;s possible this willingness is really a smoke screen, that Maloney may be using these presentations to show his senior management that the days of relying on consultants are over. It&#8217;s also possible that just the opposite is the case. At the end of the day, Maloney will do whatever he thinks is right for the future financial health of GloBank, including the selective use of consultants if he sees their value.</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>The <Italic>reasons</Italic> column should address each of the facts and assumptions. For example, the team can ask itself why Maloney doesn&#8217;t like consultants. Is he a controlling person who likes to feel in charge at all times? Does he believe in driving policy from the top down? Has he had unpleasant experiences with consultants or is his attitude due to hearsay?</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>In the <Italic>replies</Italic> column, the team should develop specific strategies and responses for addressing each fact, assumption, and reason listed in the first two columns. If team members believe Maloney doesn&#8217;t like consultants, they should demonstrate Flynn Fuller&#8217;s overall operating principles, its beliefs as a consultancy, and its specific value to GloBank. One presentation point might be: &#8220;For every dollar invested in Flynn Fuller, GloBank received X dollars in return, and here is our evidence.&#8221;</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>Once the team has sufficiently completed the strategic framework, they can build the presentation in a &#8220;consultative selling&#8221; mode &#8212; for example, stating Flynn Fuller&#8217;s principles and beliefs relative to growth management and turnarounds, its unique industry knowledge and insights, the value it has delivered to GloBank, its unique methodologies, and the credentials and skills of its financial services people. They can apply this framework to develop a professional, polished, and targeted presentation that clearly articulates the firm&#8217;s ability to address Maloney&#8217;s concerns. And if the presentation is delivered in a professional and &#8220;be bright, be brief, be gone&#8221; way, the team may make a sufficiently favorable impression on Maloney and his CFO to be retained.</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>Will Flynn Fuller&#8217;s effort be for naught? Perhaps. But if the consultants convince Maloney to keep them on, they may not only hold on to their GloBank revenues but increase them as they pick up a larger share of the consulting pot.</Paragraph>

						<Paragraph>Jeff is panicking. His fear of failure and  humiliation is driving his decision making right now. He needs to pull himself together and remember the value his company has delivered to GloBank over the years.</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>Jeff&#8217;s team members are more concerned with saving face than with solving their biggest customer&#8217;s problem. John Castle&#8217;s suggestion that Jeff should make a play to Maloney&#8217;s taste in whiskey is misguided; it would absolutely backfire. Alexandra is right to propose focusing on past successes, but she should be braver &#8212; that is, willing to talk about mistakes as well as successes, otherwise they&#8217;ll have little credibility with Maloney. Mark Tannenbaum is correct to advocate a display of industry expertise, but he needs to take a more open, less defensive stance. Differentiation, as Jane McCreary notes, is critical; yet someone like Maloney is not going to value an in-depth discussion of methodology.</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>Jim Whalen is the only one who&#8217;s on target. Focusing on financial returns is the only way to convince this fiscally minded CEO of Flynn Fuller&#8217;s past and continuing worth to GloBank. Maloney is smart; he prides himself on his reputation, and he wants to make his business successful and productive again as quickly as possible. The only consultants he will respect, therefore, are those who speak his language of toughness, competence, and practicality. During the presentation, Jeff must show that he thinks like Maloney by focusing on Flynn Fuller&#8217;s return on investment over the years. The examples of cost savings and revenue growth spurred by the consultants&#8217; advice must be both true and convincing. If the numbers are either inflated or unverifiable, Maloney will give Jeff the thumbs-down. At the same time, Jeff should approach this presentation as though it were an initial sales call, providing Maloney with important background information.</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>Jeff and his team should have a few key messages as they develop the presentation and make sure these messages shine through in both their verbal commentary and their visuals. They should also keep the number of slides to a minimum &#8212; roughly ten slides should do the trick. If three or fewer GloBank executives attend, they can use a handout; if the group is larger, they should stand and use a projector. The slides must be clear and graphical, and each should make only one big point.</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>After a single slide introducing Flynn Fuller and its work at GloBank, they should lay out their most impressive return on investment statistics and excellent results, highlighting the expertise of the group assigned to GloBank. Then they should describe some of the success they&#8217;ve had with other banking clients. Finally, they should conclude with points about where they&#8217;d like to go with GloBank and how they can help Maloney achieve the results he expects in the future.</Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>It&#8217;s critically important for Jeff and the two people who accompany him &#8212; presumably Alexandra Manning and Mark Tannenbaum, who know the account best &#8212; to practice their delivery and answers to questions. They must not be wedded to their notes or to the script of the slides; the aim is complete, comfortable control of their information. As they deliver the presentation in front of each other, they should fine-tune it, eliminating anything that sounds like consultant-speak or lacks examples. They should give each other feedback on tone. They want to sound neither defensive nor arrogant &#8212; just confident. Their goal is to show Maloney that they are proud of their work but also objective about it.<TextFlow Role="CallOut">
						<Paragraph Role="CallOut">Jeff&#8217;s team members are more concerned with saving face than with solving their biggest customer&#8217;s problem.</Paragraph>
				</TextFlow></Paragraph>
						<Paragraph>They need to think about how to demonstrate their desire to partner with Maloney to achieve the results he&#8217;s looking for. One example might be to respond to pricing inquiries with the offer of a risk-sharing agreement, in which GloBank pays on delivery of results, with a possible bonus for overachievement. Ultimately, the tougher they are on themselves during their preparation and the more confidently they deliver their presentation, the more likely they&#8217;ll be to impress the skeptical CEO.</Paragraph>
