   	<Paragraph>Two-and-a-half months after Theo Epstein left the Red Sox, certain that his heart and soul were no longer fully invested in the job of general manager, the Sox Thursday night announced that the 32-year-old Brookline native will be returning to the organization as soon as next week. Epstein's exact role and title had not been completely determined as of Thursday night. Nor had it been decided exactly how co-GMs Jed Hoyer and Ben Cherington would be recast. The club, in a release, indicated only that Epstein would be rejoining the Sox in a ''full-time baseball operations capacity, details of which will be announced next week." However, expectations within the organization point to Epstein returning as the lead decision-maker within baseball operations, with Hoyer and Cherington working under him. While Epstein's return had been rumored for weeks, only after 11 weeks of conversations among Epstein, owner John W. Henry, chairman Tom Werner, and president and CEO Larry Lucchino did the team's ownership and its former protege bridge the philosophical divides that led Epstein to leave the team on Halloween night. ''We have engaged in healthy, spirited debates about what it will take over the long term for the Red Sox to remain a great organization and, in fact, become a more effective organization in philosophy, approaches, and ideals," the four men said in a statement released through the club's public relations department. ''Ironically, Theo's departure has brought us closer together in many respects and, thanks to these conversations, we now enjoy the bonds of a shared vision for the organization's future that did not exist on Oct. 31 [when Epstein resigned].</Paragraph>
