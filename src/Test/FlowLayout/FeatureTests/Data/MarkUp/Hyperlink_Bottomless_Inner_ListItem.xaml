Nixon also said he respected Yankees first baseman Jason Giambi, who is the focus of a controversy surrounding steroid use in baseball.

Without admitting that he used steroids, Giambi apologized last week to his teammates, fans and the media for distractions he caused.

"I don't feel sorry for Giambi but I do have a great amount of respect for him,
