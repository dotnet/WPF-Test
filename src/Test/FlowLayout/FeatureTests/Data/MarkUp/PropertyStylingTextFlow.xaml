		<Paragraph>
			Raincoast Books, the Canadian publisher of the Harry Potter series, is in full damage-control mode after a B.C. store prematurely sold up to 15 copies of the latest book last week.
		</Paragraph>

		<Paragraph>
			Raincoast heard about the gaffe on Friday, the day after the books were sold at the Real Canadian Superstore in Coquitlam â€“ more than a week before the July 16 official release.
		</Paragraph>

		<Paragraph>
			On Saturday, the B.C. Supreme Court granted Raincoast a court injunction to help get the books back, and keep a lid on the plot.

		<Paragraph>
			Company spokesperson Jamie Broadhurst says some of the purchasers have voluntarily returned their copies. And he says the company is offering a reward to get the others returned.
		</Paragraph>

		<Paragraph>
			"We're asking them to contact us and to temporarily return their copies of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince to us," he says.

		</Paragraph>

		<Paragraph>
			"And in exchange, what we will do, is on July 16 at one minute past midnight, we will return their copies to them along with a signed autographed bookplate to be affixed in their book from J.K. Rowling, and some gift items as well."
		</Paragraph>

		<Paragraph>
			The injunction also bars anyone from leaking the plot of the latest Harry Potter book before 12:01 a.m. this Saturday.

		</Paragraph>

		<Paragraph>
			The injunction exempts the book's official public relations campaign.
		</Paragraph>

		<Paragraph>
			This latest incident is similar to one in 2003 when a Wal-Mart in Quebec accidentally sold a few copies of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix before the release date.
