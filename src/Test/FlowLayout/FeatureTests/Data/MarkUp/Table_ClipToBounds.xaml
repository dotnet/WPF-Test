                        Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary 
                        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore- 
                        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping 
                        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door 
                        " 'T is some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door- 
                        Only this and nothing more." 
                    </Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph>
                        Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; 
                        And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. 
                        Eagerly I wished the morrow;-vainly I had sought to borrow 
                        From my books surcease of sorrow-sorrow for the lost Lenore- 
                        For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore- 
                        Nameless here for evermore.

                    <Paragraph>
                        Then the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain 
                        Thrilled me-filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; 
                        So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating, 
                        " 'T is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door- 
                        Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;- 
                        This it is and nothing more." 
                    </Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph>
                        Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, 
                        "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; 
                        But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, 
                        And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, 
                        That I scarce was sure I heard you"-here I opened wide the door;- 
                        Darkness there and nothing more."

                        Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, 
                        Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; 
                        But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, 
                        And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?" 
                        This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!" 
                        Merely this and nothing more. 
                    </Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph>
                        Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, 
                        Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. 
                        "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice; 
                        Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore- 
                        Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;- 
                        'T is the wind and nothing more!" 
                    </Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph>
                        Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, 
                        In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore; 
                        Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; 
                        But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door- 
                        Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door- 
                        Perched, and sat, and nothing more. 
                    </Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph>
                        Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, 
                        By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, 
                        "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said,"art sure no craven, 
                        Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore- 
                        Tell me what they lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!" 
                        Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore." 
                    </Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph>
                        Much I marvelled the ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, 
                        Though its answer little meaning-little relevancy bore; 
                        For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being 
                        Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door- 
                        Bird or beast upon the culptured bust above his chamber door, 
                        With such name as "Nevermore."
