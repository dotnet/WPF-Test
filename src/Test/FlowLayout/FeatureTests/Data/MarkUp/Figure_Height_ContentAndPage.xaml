	<Paragraph>
	PHILADELPHIA -- He's one of the only remaining Sox players who can still provide ammo for the fellowship of the miserable. Oh, there's still some local grumbling about Keith Foulke, Alan Embree, and now Ramon Vazquez, but Mark Bellhorn is the big dartboard for those who find fault with a first-place team that has won seven straight games.</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>Bellhorn's an easy target. It seems that all he does is strike out and walk. He's batting only .229 and he's whiffed an amazing 83 times in 69 games. Fans will accept strikeouts if you hit a lot of homers, but Bellhorn's gone over the bridge only five times.</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>He was not the most entertaining player in the Philly finale: that trophy goes to David Wells, who staggered through five innings, giving up 10 hits and five runs and entertaining millions with a base hit, an RBI, nimble fielding, and a hilarious sprint to cover first base in which he was beaten at the wire by fellow belly-bumper, Jim Thome. If there'd been a hamburger on the bag, my money's on Wells.</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>Tie goes to the runner in my book," said Wells. ''That wasn't fun at all. I would have had him, but he broke his bat on the swing and the bat went by me and I had to wait for it."</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>Later, Wells added, ''We showed a lot of character in this one. We gave up the lead, then came out and put a four-spot on there."</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>Bellhorn's hit was the key blow. He already had a walk, a homer, an RBI single, and three runs when he came to the plate in an 8-8 game with Johnny Damon on first and none out in the eighth. In a very uncharacteristic move, he swung at the first pitch (computers must have tilted in Kansas) and cracked a double over the head of center fielder Jason Michaels.</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>''I was just looking for a good pitch to hit," said the polite, yet always bland Bellhorn.</Paragraph>
