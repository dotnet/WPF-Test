		</Floater>PHILADELPHIA -- He's one of the only remaining Sox players who can still provide ammo for the fellowship of the miserable. Oh, there's still some local grumbling about Keith Foulke, Alan Embree, and now Ramon Vazquez, but Mark Bellhorn is the big dartboard for those who find fault with a first-place team that has won seven straight games.</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>And then there's the Bellhorn look. With his long hair and sideburns, he could be one of the Sweathogs from ''Welcome Back, Kotter." Tom Werner could cast him in ''That '70s Show." We half expect to see him carrying a pack of Marlboros in the rolled-up sleeve of a white T-shirt.</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>Bellhorn plays the game without expression, prompting some fans to believe he doesn't care. They'd rather see a guy like Trot Nixon, spitting nails and smashing water coolers after striking out.</Paragraph>

		</Floater>So Bellhorn stands almost alone as the Sox rumble through this giddy ride of the 2005 season. While most of his teammates walk on water around Boston, Bellhorn tiptoes on hot coals in the players' parking lot at Fenway Park. The harsh Hub might be getting to him. He's hitting only .162 at home, compared with .286 on the road.</Paragraph>
