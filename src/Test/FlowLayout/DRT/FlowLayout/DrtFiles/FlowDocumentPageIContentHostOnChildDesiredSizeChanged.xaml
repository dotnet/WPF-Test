Nevertheless its emphasis on grains, especially whole grains, smartly counters the claims of 
anticarbohydrate diets. Its basic notion that calories count reinforces an idea that has been 
around for far longer than the obesity epidemic. And its insistence in exchanging plant for animal 
products, despite the obvious influence of the dairy industry in the overall recommendations, points 
the way to the semivegetarian (or flexitarian, to use an up-and-coming word) diet that is becoming 
increasingly common.

But the guidelines' overwhelming specificity, proclaiming that the "average 2,000-calorie" 
diet should now include four and a half cups of fruits and vegetables a day, makes the diet more 
complicated than need be. For the majority of Americans the simple facts are these: We should be 
consuming fewer calories; eating more fruits, vegetables and whole grains; eating less meat and dairy; 
and cutting back on sugar, fat and foods high in simple carbohydrates.
