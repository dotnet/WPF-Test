In a recipe for lasagna, she instructed cooks to moisten the pan ''with a little bit of meat sauce, 
skimming it from the top, where there is more fat.'' About the gorgonzola in a fettuccine recipe, she wrote,

mustard and spreading it on toasts with a dash of mascarpone.

Biting into a brioche, Victor chimed in. ''The one thing you have to give the French credit 
for is their pastries,'' he said. Asked if he ever cooked, Victor looked at Marcella and said, 
''I make a very good risotto, don't I?''
