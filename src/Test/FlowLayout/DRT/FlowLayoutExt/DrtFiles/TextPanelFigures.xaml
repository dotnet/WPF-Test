    A 2001 study found that 14 million employees in the United States  more than one-third of 
    40 million employees online  have their Internet or e-mail use at work under continuous 
    surveillance. Worldwide, the number of employees under surveillance is estimated at 27 
    million, according to the Privacy Foundation study. Though still largely the domain of 
    corporations, an increasing number of small businesses are monitoring employee Web and e-mail

    were monitoring employee Web use, with 10% of the respondents also taking action to block 
    certain sites considered inappropriate.
