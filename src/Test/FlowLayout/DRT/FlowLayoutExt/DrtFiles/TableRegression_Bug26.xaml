                    <Paragraph>Daniel Vettori sent down as many as 139 overs, 45 of them maiden, in the two Tests against India. That, 139, is the total number of overs Scott Styris, Jacob Oram, Ian Butler and Craig McMillan bowled among them.
Though he managed to take just five wickets in the series, Vettori managed to dry up the runs and make life difficult for the Indian batsmen in their own backyard, something he says was his brief for the tour.Considered one of the finest left-arm spinners today, the bespectacled Vettori, who made his Test debut at the age of 18, is, however, more happy with his batting than his bowling on the tour.
In an exclusive interview with Faisal Shariff, Vettori analysed the Test series and rated India as the toughest place anywhere in the world to bowl. Excerpts:Batting was very good. With regards to my bowling, I think I bowled well, but you have to take wickets and I would have liked to take some more wickets. I put pressure and picked wickets, but I would have liked to take wickets. I think I did a reasonable job and am happy with my overall performance.

Why is important to create pressure rather than to attack and pick wickets?Jacob Oram, with a ferocious 81, and wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum, with a 47-ball 51, put up a crucial partnership of 68 runs in 55 balls for the eighth-wicket as New Zealand ended at 258 for 9.</Paragraph>
