  <Paragraph FontWeight="Bold">What is Avalon?</Paragraph>
  <Paragraph Margin="10">
    Avalon is the code name of a development team within Microsoft that is working on the platform for 
    the next-generation of Microsoft Windows client applications.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph Margin="10">
    Avalon is not a product or a code name of a product. The technologies that are produced by the Avalon team 
    are a very important part of the Longhorn Client Developer Platform. Many teams throughout the company 
    as well as Avalon contribute important technologies to Longhorn, and it is potentially misleading and confusing 
    to refer to anything as being an "Avalon application." Rather than referring to Avalon as a specific set 
    of functionality you can install on a machine, it is more accurate to refer to the "Longhorn Client Developer 
    Platform" to convey that the next generation of Windows is the product that delivers this functionality.
