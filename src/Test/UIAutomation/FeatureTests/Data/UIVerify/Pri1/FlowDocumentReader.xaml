				<Paragraph>FlowDocumentReader: combines the functionality of both FlowDocumentPageViewer and FlowDocumentScrollViewer. It includes features that enable the user to dynamically choose between various viewing modes, including a single-page (page-at-a-time) viewing mode, a two-page-at-a-time (book reading format) viewing mode, and a continuous scrolling (bottomless) viewing mode. If you do not need the ability to dynamically switch between different viewing modes, there are lighter-weight flow content viewers that are fixed in a particular viewing mode.</Paragraph>
