[![Build Status](https://dnceng-public.visualstudio.com/public/_apis/build/status/dotnet/wpf/dotnet.wpf-test%20CI)](https://dnceng-public.visualstudio.com/public/_build?definitionId=81)

This repository contains the source code of the tests for WPF UI Framework. It has the test infrastructure and different suites of tests ( DRTs, Microsuites and Feature Tests) for testing different areas of WPF. 

This repo is currently under the process of being open-sourced. We are tracking the progress here [Test Repository Migration](https://github.com/orgs/dotnet/projects/145)


## Getting started

Follow the [Developer Guide](docs/developer-guide.md) instructions for machine setup and understanding the workflow.

### Quickstart

In order to run the tests on your local machine,

- Build the tests with `build.cmd` script. Use `/help` parameter to check the different arguments that can be passed along with the build command.
- cd into `$(RepoRoot)\publish\test\$(Configuration)\$(Platform)\Test` and run `RunDrts.cmd` to run the DRT tests.

At the end of the run, you should see something like this:

```
  A total of 84 test Infos were processed, with the following results.
   Passed: 84
   Failed (need to analyze): 0
   Failed (with BugIDs): 0
   Ignore: 0

```

Once the tests run, the results are generated here `C:\Users\$(CurrentUser)\AppData\Roaming\QualityVault\Run\Report`. You can see the result of the run in `testResults.xml` file.

Check out the [building, running and debugging tests](docs/building-running-debugging.md) doc for more information.

For more information regarding the test infrastructure and test addition guidelines, check out the following docs:

* [Building, Running and Debugging Tests](docs/building-running-debugging.md)

## How to engage, contribute, and give feedback

Some of the best ways to contribute are to try things out, file bugs and fix issues. 

Since not all the tests have been ported yet, we maintain an internal repo of test code along with this repo. Both core team members and external contributors shall **send pull requests here**, which will be reviewed and then backported to internal repo as well.

In order to start contributing directly to the code base, checkout the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)
